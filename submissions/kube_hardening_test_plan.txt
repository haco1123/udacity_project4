Kubernetes-Specific Test Plan
A Kubernetes-specific test plan focuses on validating changes to the cluster while ensuring its stability, functionality and security. The plan involves testing the changes in a controlled environment, monitoring their impact, and verifying that the cluster operates as expected.

How will you test the changes?
A combination of functional and automated tests is used to test the changes.
To avoid impacting the production environment, a staging environment is used.
Using tools such as kubectl, Prometheus and Grafana, the entire cluster can be monitored and its status recorded.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?


To ensure that the changes do not negatively impact the cluster, all tests are performed in a non-productive environment.
During these tests, data such as data traffic, CPU. and memory usage, and system errors are recorded and evaluated.
It is also important to conduct a comprehensive security check after changes are made and to resolve any security issue that arise.
