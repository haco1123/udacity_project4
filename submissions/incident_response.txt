1. Incident commander name:
Leon GÃ¼nther

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
The payload.sh script created 3 new pods (cryptotonight, minergate, moneropool) as crypto miners at default namespace. 

3. Summary of what was affected:
05/12: 3 new crypto mining pods where established: minergate, moneropool and cryptotonight.
An attacker was able to get control of the cluster and run these 3 containers on the cluster.

4. Summmry of the impact:
05/12: The CPU, Memory and Bandwith usage in the Kubernets Compute Resource Cluster Dashboard was increased after established the 3 new containers.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
Run "kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force" for all 3 pods created by the attacker.
The Dashboards are showing normal values after removing the pods.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
We don't install unknown, unused or old packages pr images in our software or cluster. 
Also we need to protect us to get loaded unexpacted images by an attacker.
Both can be archived to use security software like docker-bench, kube-bench and grype. With Falco it is possible to monitore our cluster and create useful dashboards in Grafana.
