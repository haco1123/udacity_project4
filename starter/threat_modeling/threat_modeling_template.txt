Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

1. Spoofing
Threat: An attacker could spoof a container's identity by manipulating container IDs or credentials.
Mitigation: Use strong authentication mechanisms and enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for container management.

2. Tampering
Threat: An attacker could tamper with container images by injecting malicious code into the image during the build or pull process.
Mitigation: Use signed and verified images from trusted registries and implement image scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities.

4. Information Disclosure
Threat: Sensitive data, such as environment variables or secrets, could be exposed within containers.
Mitigation: Use secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) and avoid hardcoding sensitive information in container configurations.

5. Denial of Service (DoS)
Threat: An attacker could overwhelm the Docker host by running resource-intensive containers, leading to service unavailability.
Mitigation: Implement resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers and monitor resource usage to detect anomalies.

6. Elevation of Privilege
Threat: An attacker could exploit a misconfigured container running with root privileges to gain control of the host system.
Mitigation: Run containers as non-root users and use security tools like AppArmor or SELinux to enforce least privilege.


Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

1. Spoofing
Threat: An attacker could spoof the identity of a Kubernetes service account or node to gain unauthorized access to cluster resources.
Mitigation: Use strong authentication mechanisms like mutual TLS for Kubernetes components and enforce RBAC to limit access.

2. Tampering
Threat: An attacker could tamper with Kubernetes manifests or configurations to deploy malicious workloads or modify existing workloads.
Mitigation: Use version-controlled configuration management tools and enforce admission controllers like OPA/Gatekeeper to validate configurations.

4. Information Disclosure
Threat: Sensitive data, such as secrets or configuration files, could be exposed through misconfigured Kubernetes resources or APIs.
Mitigation: Use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive data securely, enable encryption at rest, and restrict access to the Kubernetes API.

5. Denial of Service (DoS)
Threat: An attacker could overwhelm the Kubernetes cluster by deploying resource-intensive workloads, leading to service unavailability.
Mitigation: Implement resource quotas and limits for namespaces, enable pod-level resource constraints, and monitor cluster resource usage.

6. Elevation of Privilege
Threat: An attacker could exploit a misconfigured pod running with elevated privileges to gain control of the Kubernetes node or cluster.
Mitigation: Avoid running pods with privileged mode, use PodSecurityPolicies (or Pod Security Standards), and enforce least privilege for workloads.


Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).

2.13 Ensure centralized and remote logging is configured:
- Tampering: Without centralized logging, attackers could tamper with local logs to hide their tracks.
- Information Disclosure: Logs may contain sensitive information that could be exposed if not securely managed.
- Elevation of Privilege: Lack of logging makes it harder to detect privilege escalation attempts.

5.26 Ensure that the container is restricted from acquiring additional privileges:
- Spoofing: Containers with elevated privileges could be used to spoof other containers or services, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- Elevation of Privilege: Prevents containers from gaining additional privileges that could be exploited by attackers.
- Tampering: Reduces the risk of attackers modifying container behavior by escalating privileges.

5.11 Ensure that the memory usage for containers is limited:
- Denial of Service: Prevents a single container from consuming excessive resources and causing service outages.
- Tampering: A container consuming excessive memory could disrupt other containers, potentially leading to tampering with their operations or data.
- Elevation of Privilege: A container with unrestricted memory usage could exploit vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and compromise the host system.
